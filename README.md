# color-conversion
This repository contains Python scripts for converting colors between different formats. It is similar to code used by [ColorWiki](https://colorwiki.org).

There is indeed a [Python library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/colorsys.html) for doing this, but it might be useful to understand the algorithm behind color conversion.
